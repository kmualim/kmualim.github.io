I'm currently a researcher in the [Department of Genetics](https://med.stanford.edu/genetics.html) at Stanford, where I work with Professor [Anshul Kundaje](https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/) to build computational models to study the regulatory code. More recently, I've been building and adapting computational tools to study how plants adapt to changing climates with Professor [Moisés Expósito-Alonso](https://www.moisesexpositoalonso.org/) at the [Carnegie Institute of Science](https://dpb.carnegiescience.edu/). 

I work on a range of problems in genetics and biotechnology. I've built [computational tools](http://kmualim.github.io/publications/2020-05-01-abc) to understanding the non-coding regulatory genome, implemented solutions to advance [disease risk](http://kmualim.github.io/publications/2021-05-01-diseaserisk) and thought up [analytical solutions to estimating population divergence](http://kmualim.github.io/publications/2021-05-01-popgen). While I enjoy building computational models and scientific explorations, I also love the outdoors, meeting new people and experimenting with recipes!

I also spend my time community organizing with the [Sunrise Movement](https://www.sunrisemovement.org/green-new-deal/) and engage in different
[projects](https://kmualim.github.io/publications/).
