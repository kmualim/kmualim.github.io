I'm currently a Research Assistant in the [Department of Genetics](https://med.stanford.edu/genetics.html) at Stanford and the [Department of Plant Biology](https://dpb.carnegiescience.edu/) at the Carngie Instutite of Science, where I work with [Anshul Kundaje](https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/) and [Moisés Expósito-Alonso](https://www.moisesexpositoalonso.org/) to build computational models to explore transcription factor binding landscapes and figure out how plants adapt to changing climates. 

I currently work on a range of problems in genetics and biotechnology. While I enjoy building computational models, I also love to hike, meet new people and reinvent the ways we enjoy and consume food!
