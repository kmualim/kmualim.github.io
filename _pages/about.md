I'm currently a PhD Student with Dr. [Mois√©s Exp√≥sito-Alonso](https://www.moisesexpositoalonso.org/) building and adapting computational tools to study how plants adapt to changing climates at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://ib.berkeley.edu/). Previously, I was a researcher in the [Department of Genetics](https://med.stanford.edu/genetics.html) at Stanford, where I work with Dr. [Anshul Kundaje](https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/) and Dr. [Jesse Engreitz](https://www.engreitzlab.org/) to build computational models to study the regulatory code. 

I work on a range of problems in genetics and biotechnology. I've built [computational tools](http://kmualim.github.io/publications/2020-05-01-abc) to understanding the non-coding regulatory genome, implemented solutions to advance [disease risk](http://kmualim.github.io/publications/2021-05-01-diseaserisk), built [compendiums of enhancer-gene linking resources](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.09.563812v1) and thought up [analytical solutions to estimating population divergence](http://kmualim.github.io/publications/2021-05-01-popgen). 

I love being outdoors - camping üèïÔ∏è, backpacking üå≤, you name it! I also spend my time community organizing with the [Sunrise Movement](https://www.sunrisemovement.org/green-new-deal/) and engage in different
[projects](https://kmualim.github.io/publications/). More recently, I've been spending my time working on a [conservation documentary focussed on highlighting inclusive voices to create locally-adapted solutions](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/tech-ethics/ethics-society-and-technology-hub/2022-collaborative-research-projects).
