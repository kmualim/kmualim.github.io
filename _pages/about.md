I'm currently a Research Assistant in the [Department of Genetics](https://med.stanford.edu/genetics.html) at Stanford and the [Department of Plant Biology](https://dpb.carnegiescience.edu/) at the Carngie Instutite of Science, where I work with [Anshul Kundaje](https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/) and [Moisés Expósito-Alonso](https://www.moisesexpositoalonso.org/) to build computational models to explore transcription factor binding landscapes and how plants adapt to changing climates. 

I work on a range of problems in genetics and biotechnology. I've built [computational tools](https://github.com/broadinstitute/ABC-Enhancer-Gene-Prediction/tree/master/) for understanding the regulatory genome, implemented solutions to advance [disease risk](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03446-x?proof=tNature) and thought up [analytical solutions to estimating population divergence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41437-021-00435-8). While I enjoy building computational models and scientific explorations, I also love the outdoors, meeting new people and experimenting with recipes!

I also spend my time community organizing with the [Sunrise Movement](https://www.sunrisemovement.org/green-new-deal/) and engage in different
[projects](https://kmualim.github.io/publications/).
