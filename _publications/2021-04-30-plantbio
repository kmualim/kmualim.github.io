As I start venturing into the space of plant genetics, I'm beginning to realize how easy human genetics has it. I started becoming interested in 
studying plants as a form of adaptation to climate change, both as a model to study processes that could make our food systems much more resilient in changing 
climates as well as a pure fascination with the multiple processes plants utilize to survive (such as dessication and drought tolerance).

As a professionally-trained chef, I am aware of the bias I hold when I talk animately about food but it's crazy to think that this wouldn't be a concern to 
everybody. What's crazy is that in the USA, nearly 1 in 4 households (that's 25%) experienced food security in 2020. Even before the pandemic hit, 10.5% of all U.S. households, 
experienced food insecurity at some point during 2019, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. We're looking at close to 35 million people.(1)
Isn't that insane?
